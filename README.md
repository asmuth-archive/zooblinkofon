iot9000
=======

iot9000 is the latest development in useless device technology. IOT stands for
internet of things in case you didn't know.

The current flagship model, the iot9000 Pro incorporates a shiny RGB led array,
an integrated speaker and 16 illuminated buttons in a laser-cut birch plywood
case.  Also check out the iot9000 Air which gives you most of the features you came
to love from your iot9000 Pro in a more streamlined form factor (a flower pot).

Of course, all iot9000 models support the usual features you would expect in a
next-generation smart device, such as connecting to you Wifi network and running
a number of trivial apps:

   - Animal sound board
   - Adult sound board
   - Health check monitoring
   - Stroboscope
   - Machine to Machine (M2M) communication
